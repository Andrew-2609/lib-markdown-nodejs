# My first NodeJS Library - Lib Markdown

### First Steps Taken:

1. Create a `package.json` file. For that matter, run:

   `npm init -y` (the _-y_ flag will answer all questions with "yes")


2. After that, there are a variety of ways to import libraries that can/will be useful in the project. Add their dependencies to the project via:  

   **terminal**: `npm install ${lib}`
   
   **package.json**: add the dependency to the file, then run `npm install`
